# Email Checker for Android and iOS

## Deprecated

This library is deprecated.

For Android please check out [EmailChecker-Android](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/EmailChecker-Android)

For iOS please check out [EmailTypoChecker.swift](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-iOS/blob/25f9c8c883eff1b4d727cbd04f71448d956d9ca7/WordPress/Classes/Utility/EmailTypoChecker.swift)

## Introduction

This library helps to catch simple email domain typos. Its intended to
be used as a hint when a user have to enter an email address.

The library is written in C++ and is inspired by the algorithm
described here: http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html (Warning, it's
not the exact same algo).

## How to use it in an Android project

Currently gradle doesn't support NDK, so we used a trick to make it
work: it generates a temporary .jar file containing .so, this file is
used as a jar dependency for the final .aar file.

If you want to use it in your Android project, your can add it as a
library in your build.gradle file, don't forget to add the
wordpress-mobile maven repository. For instance:

    repositories {
        maven { url 'http://wordpress-mobile.github.io/WordPress-Android' }
    }

    dependencies {
        // use the latest 0.x version
        compile 'org.wordpress:emailchecker:0.+'
    }

Sample usage:

    String emailToCheck = "salut@gmial.com";
    String suggest = (new EmailChecker()).suggestDomainCorrection(email);
    if (suggest.compareTo(email) != 0) {
        Log.v("FIXME", "did you mean: " + suggest + " ?");
    }

## How to use it in an iOS project

If you use [CocoaPods][1], you just have to add the following pod to
your dependency list:

    pod 'EmailChecker', :podspec => 'https://raw.github.com/wordpress-mobile/EmailChecker/master/ios/EmailChecker.podspec'

Sample usage:

    NSString *emailToCheck = @"salut@gmial.com";
    NSString *suggestedEmail = [EmailChecker suggestDomainCorrection: @"salut@gmial.com"];
    if (![suggestedEmail isEqualToString:emailToCheck]) {
        NSLog(@"Did you mean: %@", suggestedEmail);
    }

### The steps to add a new public method

1. Create the public method in common/
1. Wrap it as a Java jni method in android/jni and android/java
1. Wrap it as a Obj-C++ method in ios/EmailChecker/

### Build

* For Android

    ```
    $ cd android && gradle build
    ```

## CHANGELOG

### 0.2

* Failback to the identity function when native libraries can't be loaded 
  (weird Android ROMs).
* Update to gradle-android 0.8 and use gradle to build jni code

### 0.1

* Initial release
